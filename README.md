## California House Data Visualization

Data source for the visualization=> [Kaggle Dataset: California Housing 1990](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harrywang/housing?resource=download) which is based on California Census in 1990.

Data visualization is the process of representing data and information graphically, using visual elements such as charts, graphs, and maps.

Data visualization can be used to:

- Present data in a clear and concise way, making it easier to understand patterns, trends, and relationships between data points.
- Identify outliers, anomalies, and other important features in the data.
- Communicate findings and insights to others more effectively than raw data or written reports.
- Enable users to interact with the data, explore different scenarios, and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying data.
